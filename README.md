# krishna_wind_power_prediction
 Wind Power Prediction using Machine Learning :-

Dataset:-

- Downloaded the Data From Kaggle.
- 50,000+ rows of 10-min interval data.

Objective To learn for this was:-

Predict *Active Power (kW)* based on:

- Wind Speed (m/s),
- Wind Direction (°),
- Theoretical Power Curve (kWh).

To expand my knowledge by practicing the ML Model :-

- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Evaluation:

  - MAE,
  - RMSE,
  - R² Score.

Learned and showed Visualization of:-
- Actual vs Predicted Power plot
- Correlation Heatmap

Libraries i learned about by this project:-

- pandas ,
- numpy,
- matplotlib,
- seaborn,
- sickit-learn.

If you wanna see how it runs:-
